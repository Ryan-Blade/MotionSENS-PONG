# MotionSENS-PONG
The Classic Pong Game Now With New Redefined motion Controls !!
This is my 1st project that was made for my class 12th Practicals, so I am not a pro, I will gladly adhere to any constructive critisism !

Instructions on running the project file :
1) I have included comments explaining most of the stuff inside my .py script
2) Many libraries have been used for making this project, pls ensure that u pre-install them via the pip install <package_name> command in CMD or its equivalent commands in Linux.
3) U can easily change the ingame sprites,sound just by downloading the respected item and providing its path the .py script's required area.
4) ENJOY 👍
